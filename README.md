# SubtitleHelper

## A python script to help with organizing your subtitles for your series.

I have downloaded a series and the subtitles for it only to find that my TV can't handle subtitles in a separate folder. Renaming and moving the subtitles for all 12 episodes was rather inconvenient so I spent way more time than it saved to write a script to automate it.

Simply paste the path to your folders when asked for it. You'll have to double your backslashes due to them being escape characters. That is assuming that your subtitles are alphabetically in the same order as your episodes.
