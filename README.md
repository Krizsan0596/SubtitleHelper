# SubtitleHelper

## A python script to help with organizing your subtitles for your series.

I have downloaded a series and the subtitles for it only to find that my TV can't handle subtitles in a separate folder. Renaming and moving the subtitles for all 12 episodes was rather inconvenient so here is a script to automate it.

Simply replace the `subs_folder` and `episodes_folder` to match your subtitles and episodes. That is assuming that your subtitles are alphabetically in the same order as your episodes.

I understand that editing the hardcoded variables is still somewhat inconvenient (and I am working to change it to inputs) but it is just a PoC for now.
